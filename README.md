# Cardiovascular-Dataset-Analysis-and-Model-Deployment
Project Overview
This project involved analyzing a cardiovascular dataset to identify key health indicators and trends, and developing a predictive model to assess health risks. The goal was to derive actionable insights from the data and deploy a model that could predict cardiovascular conditions based on various health metrics. This project highlighted my skills in data analysis, predictive modeling, and model deployment.

Tasks Completed
Data Collection and Cleaning

Acquired a cardiovascular dataset with various health metrics.
Performed data cleaning to address missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies, ensuring a reliable dataset for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Conducted exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution of health metrics and identify key trends.
Utilized visualizations to reveal relationships between features and health outcomes.
Feature Engineering

Created and transformed features to improve the modelâ€™s predictive performance.
Applied techniques such as normalization and encoding of categorical variables.
Predictive Modeling

Developed and trained multiple predictive models to forecast cardiovascular risks.
Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.
Selected the best-performing model based on evaluation results.
Model Deployment

Deployed the predictive model for real-time health risk assessment.
Integrated the model into a user-friendly application or system for practical use.
Visualization and Reporting

Created visualizations and reports to communicate insights from the analysis and model performance.
Developed dashboards to present health trends and predictive results effectively.
Documentation

Documented the analysis workflow, feature engineering process, and model development.
Prepared comprehensive reports detailing findings and recommendations for health risk management.
